# CS989Project
Python project for a course of my MSc called "Big Data Fundamentals".
The project is practically segmented in two parts.
1. Forcasting the weekly demand
2. Comparing the consumptions of consumers with differnt tarrifs

Walk forward SARIMA was utilised to for the forecasting, while K-Means, TSNE and hypothesis tests were utilised to compare the consumptions.

The dataset can be found on [UK Power Networks](https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households "Official Page") page.
